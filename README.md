## Code of Conduct

Please note that this project is released with a Contributor [Code of
Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating in this project you agree to
abide by its terms.


## Contributing

See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md). It contains some general instructions
that should be followed when contributing to any of the Creative Commons
open-source repositories.


## Development setup

Copy `.env.template` and set environment variables (like
`DJANGO_DEBUG_ENABLED=True` for local development and testing) and secret keys
in a `.env` file.
```shell
cp .env.template .env
```


### Using Docker-Compose

Ensure that you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system
For installation instructions refer: [Get Docker | Docker
Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)


#### Start (and Build) the Servers

Start Django server (backed by PostgreSQL server ) at
[127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000/):
```sh
docker-compose up
```


#### Run Migrations

Run the migrations to create database schema (we use Postgresql in this case):
```shell
docker compose exec app ./manage.py migrate
```
**(Required after initial build)**


#### Execute Commands

To execute any commands inside the app docker container, follow this format:

```shell
docker compose exec app ./manage.py DJANGO COMMAND HERE
```
or
```shell
docker compose exec app sh -c "SHELL COMMAND HERE"
```

Examples:
- Create a Super User:
    ```shell
    docker compose exec app ./manage.py createsuperuser
    ```
- Collect static files:
    ```shell
    docker compose exec app ./manage.py collectstatic
    ```
- Compress content:
    ```shell
    docker compose exec app ./manage.py compress
    ```
- Run tests:
    ```shell
    docker compose exec app ./manage.py test
    ```


### Using Pipenv

NOTE: The prefered method is [Using Docker-Compose](#using-docker-compose).

To follow these instructions, Python 3 and
[Pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) are required.

Install dependencies with pipenv.
```shell
pipenv install --dev
```

Run the migrations to create the database (we use
Postgresql in this case).
```shell
pipenv run ./manage.py migrate
```

The next step is to create an admin account for Django admin.
```shell
pipenv run ./manage.py createsuperuser
```

Finally you can start a development server with:
```shell
pipenv run ./manage.py runserver
```
and see a local version of the website at
[127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000/).


### Webpack

Open another terminal and navigate to webpack folder using:
```shell
cd webpack
```

To install webpack dependencies use:
```shell
npm install
```
or alternatively to install from package-lock.json use:
```shell
npm ci
```

If you want to make changes to scss files during development run:
```shell
npm run watch
```

otherwise run the following command
```shell
npm run build
```

After made code changes and before commit, check code style from main directory using.


### Code Style

After making changes in code and before commit, check code style.
```shell
pipenv run isort .
pipenv run black .
pipenv run flake8 .
```
