    summary: "Lich\xF4dmapwa claimed the defendant violated all three conditions of\

      \ the work for commercial purposes, and failed to provide attribution. The defendant\
      \ claimed it had acted in good faith, arguing that it was unaware of the terms\
      \ of the CC license. The defendant also argued that since the plaintiff was\
      \ not a member of the Belgian collecting society, SABAM, they had no rights\
      \ to collect payments for use of the music.\L The court recognized the validity\
      \ of the Creative Commons license applied to the music, and held that the plaintiff\u2019\
      s decision not to join SABAM and instead to release their music more openly\
      \ should not prevent them from enforcing their copyright. The court held that\
      \ the good faith of the defendant was not an excuse for violating the license.\
      \ As a festival organizer regularly involved in licensing, the court said the\
      \ defendant should have known to look for and follow the terms of the license.\
      \ In addition, the court noted that the website from which the theater downloaded\
      \ the music, http://www.dogmazic.net, clearly mentions the CC license.\r\n\r\
      \nOn October 28, 2010, the court awarded the plaintiff 1,500 Euros per license\
      \ condition violated, 4,500 Euros in total."

      damages in the amount of $150,000 per infringement of the copyright (but no

    summary: A default judgment was entered against Music Times for failing to appear.
      The Magistrate Judge provided a recommendation and report for a $5000 statutory
      damages award given that Philpot did not pay any licensing fees (the stautory
      damages award is normally decided in relation to the costs of the licensing
      fees) and Music Times infringed Philpot's copyrights only twice. The Magistrate
      Judge suggested no attorneys fees award was warrranted given that Philpot did
      not provide any documentation to support his claim for fees, but recommended
      that he be compensated $400 in costs (which would cover the filing fee in this
      action). The District Court Judge adopted the recommendation.

    summary: The court evaluated the fair use factors and found three in favor of

      of the work, in favor of WOS, ultimately deciding that this issue is not appropriate
      for summary judgment. The court did grant summary judgment in favor of Philpot's

      the metadata and therefore could not prove the intent elements needed to succeed
      on the claims. Finally, the court held that Philpot was not entitled to summary
      judgment on WOS's fair use or licensing defenses (WOS argued that it fulfilled
      attribution "in any reasonable manner" as required by the Creative Commons license),
      but did grant Philpot summary judgment regarding WOS's unclean hands and copyright
      misuse and invalid copyright defenses.

    background: Larry Philpot is a photographer who took a photo of Willie Nelson
      and published it on Wikimedia under a Creative Commons license, which requires
      a licensee of the photo to reference the license and provide a specific photographer
      attribution. Philpot claims that Rural Media published the photo on its website,
      myruralty.com, and took it down after Philpot sent a cease and desist letter.
      Philpot then brought this suit for copyright infringement. Rural moved to dismiss
      under Rule 12(b)(2) for lack of personal jurisdiction.

    background: Larry Philpot is a freelance photographer who photographs musicians.
      Philpot sued Scene Entertainment after they reportedly reproduced Philpot's
      copyrighted photograph of Macy Gray on their website without properly attributing
      it to Philpot. Philpot charged that Scene Entertainment violated the Copyright
      Act and the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. Scene Entertainment failed to
      appear before the court, so Philpot moved for default judgment. Philpot sought
      $150,000 in statutory damages for infringement, plus attorneys fees and costs.

    summary: "Since 2002, Creative Commons has been continuously evolving in order\
      \ to create a licensing scheme that not only fulfils the needs of the author\
      \ but also stays compatible with already existing national copyright laws. The\
      \ extent of the respect of moral rights provisions has always been highlighted\
      \ during the licences\u2019 evolution. This Article first examines whether moral\
      \ rights are expressly mentioned in the licences and if so, what their treatment\
      \ is. Each element of the moral rights in the French system will be considered\
      \ in order to verify their compatibility with the Creative Commons licences.\
      \ In this context, it will be also asserted whether some existing clauses in\
      \ the licence contradict with the moral rights of authors. The Article will\
      \ conclude that although a more flexible interpretation of moral rights provisions\
      \ is needed when dealing with open content licences, it is essential that Creative\
      \ Commons addresses the aspects of the licences that are identified as problematic\
      \ in relation to moral rights. Finally, it will be demonstrated that regardless\
      \ of the legal status of the licences, the authors' responsibility towards their\
      \ rights is what will ultimately be the safeguard of their creations' path."

    summary: "Design rights represent an interesting example of how the EU legislature\
      \ has successfully regulated an otherwise heterogeneous field of law. Yet this\
      \ type of protection is not for all. The tools created by EU intervention have\
      \ been drafted paying much more attention to the industry sector rather than\
      \ to designers themselves. In particular, modern, digitally based, individual\
      \ or small-sized, 3D printing, open designers and their needs are largely neglected\
      \ by such legislation. The use of printing machinery to manufacture physical\
      \ objects created digitally thanks to computer programs such as Computer-Aided\
      \ Design (CAD) software has been in place for quite a few years, and it is actually\
      \ the standard in many industrial fields, from aeronautics to home furniture.\
      \ The change in recent years that has the potential to be a paradigm-shifting\
      \ factor is a combination between the popularization of such technologies (price,\
      \ size, usability, quality) and the diffusion of a culture based on access to\
      \ and reuse of knowledge. We will call this blendOpen Design. It is probably\
      \ still too early, however, to say whether 3D printing will be used in the future\
      \ to refer to a major event in human history, or instead will be relegated to\
      \ a lonely Wikipedia entry similarly to \u201CBetamax\u201D (copyright scholars\
      \ are familiar with it for other reasons). It is not too early, however, to\
      \ develop a legal analysis that will hopefully contribute to clarifying the\
      \ major issues found in current EU design law structure, why many modern open\
      \ designers will probably find better protection in copyright, and whether they\
      \ can successfully rely on open licenses to achieve their goals. With regard\
      \ to the latter point, we will use Creative Commons (CC) licenses to test our\
      \ hypothesis due to their unique characteristic to be modular, i.e. to have\
      \ different license elements (clauses) that licensors can choose in order to\
      \ adapt the license to their own needs."

    summary: This article analyses whether Creative Commons licences are applicable
      to and compatible with design. The first part focuses on the peculiar and complex
      nature of a design, which can benefit from a copyright and a design protection.
      This shows how it can affect the use of Creative Commons licences. The second
      and third parts deal with a specific case study. Some Internet platforms have
      recently emerged that offer users the possibility to download blueprints of
      design products in order to build them. Designers and creative users are invited
      to share their blueprints and creations under Creative Commons licences. The
      second part of the article assesses whether digital blueprints can be copyrightable
      and serve as the subject matter of Creative Commons licences, while the last
      part assesses whether the right to reproduce the digital blueprint, as provided
      by Creative Commons licences, extends to the right to build the product.

    summary: "\"Data and databases are a complex, nuanced area within intellectual\
      \ property law.\r\nIn the European Union databases have a special legal treatment\
      \ that provides two levels of protection. A database is protected by copyright\
      \ in the classical sense when it can be considered an intellectual work with\
      \ a creative nature. Where databases represent mere collections of data without\
      \ sufficient creativity to trigger copyright, EU jurisdictions protect the database\
      \ under sui generis rights when substantial investment has been made in obtaining,\
      \ verifying, or presenting the database contents according to Directive 96/9/EC.\r\
      \nThis system creates a substantial discrepancy between the situation of European\
      \ countries and the rest of the world, and also affects those databases that\
      \ have been released under open licenses.\r\nNot all of the currently available\
      \ open licenses take account of the legal and practical implications of this\
      \ discrepancy, and we should examine the consequences and options.\r\nThe paper\
      \ aims to provide a high-level analysis on the protection of databases under\
      \ European law and identify the main legal problems arising from it in an open\
      \ data scenario. Then it will focus on the solutions tried so far to implement\

    summary: "\"Openness has become a common concept in a growing number of scientific\
      \ and academic fields. Expressions such as Open Access (OA) or Open Content\
      \ (OC) are often employed for publications of papers and research results, or\
      \ are contained as conditions in tenders issued by a number of funding agencies.\
      \ More recently the concept of Open Data (OD) is of growing interest in some\
      \ fields, particularly those that produce large amounts of data \u2013 which\
      \ are not usually protected by standard legal tools such as copyright. However,\
      \ a thorough understanding of the meaning of Openness \u2013 especially its\
      \ legal implications \u2013 is usually lacking. \r\n\r\nOpen Access, Public\
      \ Access, Open Content, Open Data, Public Domain. All these terms are often\
      \ employed to indicate that a given paper, repository or database does not fall\
      \ under the traditional \u201Cclosed\u201D scheme of default copyright rules.\
      \ However, the differences between all these terms are often largely ignored\
      \ or misrepresented, especially when the scientist in question is not familiar\
      \ with the law generally and copyright in particular \u2013 a very common situation\
      \ in all scientific fields. \r\n\r\nOn 17 July 2012 the European Commission\
      \ published its Communication to the European Parliament and the Council entitled\
      \ \u201CTowards better access to scientific information: Boosting the benefits\
      \ of public investments in research\u201D. As the Commission observes, \u201C\
      discussions of the scientific dissemination system have traditionally focused\
      \ on access to scientific publications \u2013 journals and monographs. However,\
      \ it is becoming increasingly important to improve access to research data (experimental\
      \ results, observations and computer-generated information), which forms the\
      \ basis for the quantitative analysis underpinning many scientific publications\u201D\
      . The Commission believes that through more complete and wider access to scientific\
      \ publications and data, the pace of innovation will accelerate and researchers\
      \ will collaborate so that duplication of efforts will be avoided. Moreover,\
      \ open research data will allow other researchers to build on previous research\
      \ results, as it will allow involvement of citizens and society in the scientific\
      \ process. \r\n\r\nIn the Communication the Commission makes explicit reference\
      \ to open access models of publications and dissemination of research results,\
      \ and the reference is not only to access and use but most significantly to\
      \ reuse of publications as well as research data. \r\n\r\nThe Communication\
      \ marks an official new step on the road to open access to publicly funded research\
      \ results in science and the humanities in Europe. Scientific publications are\
      \ no longer the only elements of its open access policy: research data upon\
      \ which publications are based should now also be made available to the public.\
      \ \r\n\r\nAs noble as the open access goal is, however, the expansion of the\
      \ open access policy to publicly funded research data raises a number of legal\
      \ and policy issues that are often distinct from those concerning the publication\
      \ of scientific articles and monographs. Since open access to research data\
      \ \u2013 rather than publications \u2013 is a relatively new policy objective,\
      \ less attention has been paid to the specific features of research data. An\
      \ analysis of the legal status of such data, and on how to make it available\
      \ under the correct licence terms, is therefore the subject of the following\
      \ sections.\""

      a human rights approach to copyright as seen within new copyright regimes including
